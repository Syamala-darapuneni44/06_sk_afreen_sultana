            "5. **Add the garlic**: Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning.\n",
            "6. **Add the tomatoes**: Add the diced tomatoes to the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to release their juices and soften.\n",
            "7. **Return the chicken**: Add the browned chicken back to the skillet, stirring to combine with the onions, garlic, and tomatoes.\n",
            "8. **Simmer and season**: Reduce the heat to low (around 300°F/150°C) and simmer the mixture for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Season with salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs and spices.\n",

            "8. **Simmer and season**: Reduce the heat to low (around 300°F/150°C) and simmer the mixture for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Season with salt, pepper, and your choice of herbs and spices.\n",
